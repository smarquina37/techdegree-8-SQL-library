# techdegree-8-SQL-library

In this project, I created an application to manage a collection of books. I used JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize to create a dynamic website that allows a user to view a list of the books available as well as add, update, and delete books from the database.

This project provided me with an opportunity to start familiarizing myself with implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database related tools to view and interact with the database.

I learned a lot working on this project. It was a good refresher of Node.js, Express, and Pug. The route rendering and pug templates gave me trouble at first, but after learning more about how res.render/res.direct work, I was able to correctly connect my files and display in the browser.
